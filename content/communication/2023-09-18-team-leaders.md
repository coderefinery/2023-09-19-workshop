Dear all,

This email goes to all team leaders and local organizers and contains some tips for how to organize
a team in case you missed on-boarding last week or just wanted to have a summary.

First of all: Thanks so much for doing this! It's the teams and team leaders that make this workshop really work. We really appreciate!

Expect a dynamic, exciting course. Really, anything can happen, and your team will turn into what you want: Do you want to be active or to be around?
- If active: you'll need to take the lead in discussions. You don't have to discuss the active material: you could make the discussions about your own work (our material will be there later anyway).
- If "be around": During exercise sessions and other times, you can ask how it's going and take questions there. If it's too quite, ask someone to screen-share and everyone else to say what to do.

Be kind and considerate to everyone. Not everyone has to learn or do the same things. Don't make people feel bad for not doing as much as others, it's only natural!

Don't worry! Take the first day to see how it works and then adapt based on what your group would like.

It can be very, very hard to get people to talk sometimes. You can try this: Ask someone to screen-share (or you can). The person screen-sharing doesn't figure out what to do, but others tell them what to do. You can even make any exercises group-based this way.

If you meet in-person and have a large screen to share: Twitch stream on one half, Notes on the other half.

If you volunteered to be a team leader but don't have a team yet, please join the exercise Zoom rom: (URL shared with registrants)
