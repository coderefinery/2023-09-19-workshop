Dear CodeRefinery workshop partipant,

Thanks for today!
- Questions and answers from today are archived at https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-09-19-workshop/questions/
- Progress today marked on Git cheat sheet: https://fosstodon.org/@rkdarst/111092102577954826

On Thursday we will all practice how to collaborate using Git/GitHub and one ambitious thing we will try is to collaborate with participants following via stream.
- Everybody: Please make sure you have HTTPS or SSH connection to GitHub configured following https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/ssh/ (but please still come and watch even if it does not work)
- Learners in teams and exercise groups: nothing to prepare yet (you can skip rest of email)
- Individual learners who wish to actively participate: please read below and request access
- Team leaders: You can prepare the exercise repositories for Thursday following https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/centralized/#exercise-preparation and https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/distributed/#exercise-preparation (but you will get enough time for that during the workshop)

If you would like to participate **as individual learner** actively in the collaborative
exercises, please request access by opening an issue at https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/access-requests/issues/new/choose (There click "Get started" -> "Submit new issue")

This way we will know your GitHub username and give you write access to exercise repositories.

After we add you as collaborator, you will get an email from GitHub.
- Please accept the invitation
- Don't forget to "unwatch" both https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise and https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise-recorded
- Screenshot how to "unwatch" at https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/centralized/#exercise-preparation

See you tomorrow!

CodeRefinery team
