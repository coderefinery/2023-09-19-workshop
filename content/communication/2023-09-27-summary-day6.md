Dear CodeRefinery workshop participant,

We are coming close to the end!  Here is some important news:

- The last day (day 6) covers testing and modular code
  development. These really pull everything together and connect all
  of the pieces we have been learning.  It shouldn't be missed!
- The testing lesson uses the conda environment and has some good
  exercises.  The Modular code development lesson is mostly watching
  and discussing, so you can relax for the grand finale.
- It's a good time to invite your friends - the lessons are relevant
  and a new person can learn something, too.

- Our [credit/certificate
  instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-09-19-workshop/certificates/)
  have been updated: You can get 1 ECTS Credit OR certificate
  depending on your situation. Deadline to submit your homework:
  01/12/2023
- [This
    playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpLblYHCzJADyLxv8GRyxFiRJBhQ-G0NQ)
    is updated with videos the save evening as each course.
- Q&A is always updated [on the questions page](@/questions/_index.md)
  each afternoon.

See you tomorrow!

CodeRefinery team
