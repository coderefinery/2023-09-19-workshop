Dear all,

CodeRefinery workshop week 2 about to start - we are very much looking forward.

This week is like a mini-seminar series containing topics related to reproducibility and reusability. You are welcome to invite colleagues to join, also just for a part of it.

Many lessons received significant improvements over the last days and weeks.

We have decided to not provide the central exercise Zoom this week. There was almost zero interest in this in week 1 and we decided to rather focus our efforts on answering questions on collaborative notes. If you really wish a centrally organized exercise Zoom, can you please let us know?

See you tomorrow/today (Tue)!

Radovan & the CodeRefinery team
