Dear CodeRefinery workshop participant,

We are coming close to the end! Here is some important news:

The last day covers testing and modular code development. These really pull everything together and connect all of the pieces we have been learning. It shouldn't be missed!

The testing lesson uses the conda environment and has some good exercises. The Modular code development lesson is mostly watching and discussing, so you can relax for the grand finale.

It's a good time to invite your friends - the lessons are relevant and a new person can learn something, too.

Our credit/certificate instructions have been updated:
