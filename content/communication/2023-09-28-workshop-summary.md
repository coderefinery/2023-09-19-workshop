Dear all,

thank you so much for participating! Special thanks to all the exercise leaders, local organizers, volunteers, helpers, instructors, and organizers.

Please let us know how this workshop went for you. Please give us honest feedback about what went well and what didn't go so well. This feedback will be very important for us. You can give the feedback by replying to me or by writing to support@coderefinery.org.

We recognize that applying all these tools and techniques is not easy. Don't try to do things perfectly, try to do thing better. Ask for help and work together.

Consider coming to one of our "bring your own code" sessions. This is the first time we will try this:
- Schedule: https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-09-19-workshop/#schedule
- Zoom link: (URL shared with registrants)

Our lessons are open source and will stay open and accessible also in future:
https://coderefinery.org/lessons/

We are working on making them citable. Please open issues with suggestions and please send us pull requests with improvements.

If you would like a certificate or credit for the workshop, please see:

Coding can be fun and helping others with coding and computing can be heaps of fun. If you want to do more, consider the job role "research software engineer" or just doing more for fun.
