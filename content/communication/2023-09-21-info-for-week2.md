Dear CodeRefinery workshop participant,

Thank you for joining the workshop this week, and for all the wonderful questions we got  from you 
and hopefully could answer sufficiently in our collaborative document.

All these questions and answers from this week are archived at https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-09-19-workshop/questions/

We hope you got some good practice and understanding on how to collaborate using Git/GitHub and 
our trial of collaborating with you from the stream worked out for you!

Next week will be a little more diverse! 

We will take a peek into 6 topics that are all related to FAIR research software development: 

Tuesday will start with an overview of how all CodeRefinery lessons fit together under the umbrella of reproducible research 
and what steps you can take now already to make your research more reproducible. In the afternoon we will look into licenses, 
how they work and why you might want to care even when "only writing a small script for myself". 

Wednesday morning we look at different ways of how to document research code. From small projects with good README files to 
external documentation on readthedocs. In the afternoon we will show some tips and tricks around jupyter notebooks and what 
they can be used for also outside of courses.

Thursday we step a little deeper into softyware development practices by giving you a peek into automated testing and how this
could benefit you and your collaborators. The workshop ends with some live coding to showcase how any code can become more reusable 
by caring about modularity. 

In preparation for week 2 you will need the coderefinery conda environment set up on your computer. 
There is no other prerequisites for the different lessons, but in some you may try out your git skills again :)

We hope to see you again in any of our sessions of week 2!
