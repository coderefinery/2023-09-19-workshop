Dear CodeRefinery workshop participant,

Thank you for joining the workshop this week, and for all the wonderful questions we got from you
and hopefully could answer sufficiently in our collaborative document.

All these questions and answers from this week are archived at https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-09-19-workshop/questions/

Video recordings are up: https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-09-19-workshop/#news

We hope you got some good practice and understanding on how to collaborate using Git/GitHub and
our trial of collaborating with you from the stream worked out for you!
If you have suggestions on how to improve our lessons, please open issues or send pull requests: https://github.com/coderefinery

Next week will be a little more diverse!

We will take a peek into 6 topics that are all related to FAIR research software development:

Tuesday will start with an overview of how all CodeRefinery lessons fit together under the umbrella of reproducible research
and what steps you can take now already to make your research more reproducible. In the afternoon we will look into licenses,
how they work and why you might want to care even when "only writing a small script for myself".

Wednesday morning we look at different ways of how to document research code. From small projects with good README files to
external documentation on Read the Docs. In the afternoon we will show some tips and tricks around Jupyter notebooks and how
they can be used also outside of courses.

Thursday we step a little deeper into software development practices by giving you a peek into automated testing and how this
could benefit you and your collaborators. The workshop ends with some live coding to showcase how to make code more reusable
by caring about modularity.

In preparation for week 2 we recommend that you set up the coderefinery conda environment on your computer
following https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/. And for most lessons
we will try out our new Git skills again :)

We hope to see you again in any of our sessions of week 2!

CodeRefinery team
