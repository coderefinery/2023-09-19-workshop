### Changes compared to last workshop

- Sessions in week 2 have more time between them to make it easier to join only few
  sessions and to add more time to some sessions that needed it.
- We again provide a central exercise Zoom for individual learners and individual
  volunteer team leaders.
- Simpler registration. Participants using partner registration pages do not
  have to register in two places.
- Improve experience for team leaders.
