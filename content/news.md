### Changes compared to last workshop ([blog post](https://coderefinery.org/blog/2023/06/25/planning-sep-workshop/))

- We added a lunch break between sessions (we understand this is good for some time zones and less good for others).
  Main motivation was to create well defined sessions which can be attended also separately.
- We again provide a central exercise Zoom for individual learners and individual
  volunteer team leaders.
- Simpler registration. Participants using partner registration pages do not
  have to register in two places.
- Improve experience for team leaders.
